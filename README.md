# Websites I made in college

Some websites I made for competitions and certificates at [The National College of Computer Science Piatra-Neamt](https://cni.nt.edu.ro/)  

:mag_right: The first folder contains a website made for a competition called "History and Society in the Virtual Domain". It's a project about contributions made by romanian inventors, doctors, enginers, and so on.<br><br>
:books: The second folder is a project made for a certificate, it contains a clone-parody Wordle with words from Romanian literature, or at least meanings from literature, and a start page that contains several pages about literary currents.
